# Influence of Design on Differential and Linear Propagation Properties of Block Cipher Family Skinny

In this bachelor thesis, the following research question will be answered:
*How do the linear and nonlinear layers in the round function of Skinny interact when it comes to the differential and linear propagation properties?*


## Espresso Algorithm
The folder EspressoAlgorithm holds the input files for the Espresso algorithm and the source code of this algorithm.

### espresso-logic-minimizer

A modern (2017) compiliable re-host of the [Espresso heuristic logic minimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso_heuristic_logic_minimizer).
The original source code comes from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/pubs/downloads/espresso/index.htm).

### Install

```
$ cd espresso-src
$ make
```

The espresso executable will be located in the `bin` directory. Manual pages are available in the `man` directory. Copy these files to your desired location.
To run the espresso executable with our `skinny64.in` and `skinny128.in` files, these two files should be copied to the directory `bin`.

### Delete

```
$ cd espresso-src
$ make clean
```

This comment will delete the espresso executable and object files.

### Package Availability
This package is [available](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/espresso-logic/) on the Arch User Repository.
If you would like to package it for your preferred distribution, you can submit a PR to have it listed here.

## Software Tools
The folder SoftwareTools is based on [the code used for the paper Thinking Outside the Superbox](https://github.com/ongetekend/) written by Nicolas Bordes, Joan Daemen, DaniÃ«l Kuijsters and Gilles Van Assche.
In order to run our code we made some small changes to the file `global-common.c` and `global-common.h`.
Note that if my code will be run together with the original code, the following files will need to be changed (renaming of the function `box_weight` to `box_weight32`):
* `spongent-box-weight.c`
* `saturnin-differential-trail-weight-three-rounds.c`
* `saturnin-linear-trail-weight-three-rounds.c`
* `identity-box-weight.c`

Because of dependencies inside the SoftwareTools folder in the [original repository](https://github.com/ongetekend/), we needed to copy the following files as well (next to the modified `global_common.c` and `global_common.h` files):
* `convolution.c`
* `convolution.h`
* `csvparser.c`
* `csvparser.h`
* `table.c`
* `table.h`
* `table_fixed.c`
* `table_fixed.h`
* `walsh_transform.c`
* `walsh_transform.h`

Some CSV files from the [original `data` folder](https://github.com/ongetekend/) are copied inside our `data` folder. This is needed because of the comparison of Skinny against Rijndael, Saturnin, Spongent and Xoodoo in this bachelor thesis.

### Install

```
$ make && make install
```

The executables will be located in the `bin` directory. Running these will make CSV files inside the `data-skinny` directory.

### Delete

```
$ make clean
```

This comment will delete all binaries and object files.

### Prerequisite Libraries

In order to run this code, GMP and NTL are needed.
